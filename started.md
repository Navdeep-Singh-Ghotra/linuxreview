######  1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.

A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software. It also does a whole lot of other things, but we’ll dig into that in a different course. For now, just know that the kernel controls pretty much everything that happens on your system.

During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX like-systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.

Then in 1991, a young fellow named Linus Torvalds started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.

 Debian There are three branches that you can use, Stable, Testing and Unstable. Debian may not get the latest updates, but it's extremely stable.
 
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source code for free. RPM package manager, mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server OS this would be a good one.

Ubuntu is a Debian-based operating system, uses a core Debian package management system

Fedora Backed by Red Hat, the Fedora Project is community driven containing open-source and free software. Uses Red Hat package manager. Fedora is great if you want a Red Hat based operating system without the price tag.

Linux Mint is based off of Ubuntu.  If you prefer a lighter distro than Ubuntu, you may be interested in Linux Mint. it uses the Debian package manager.

Gentoo Gentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating system at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the system. Gentoo uses its own package management, Portage.

Arch Linux a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution driven 100% by the community. You really need to get your hands dirty to understand the system and its functions, but in turn you get complete and total control of your system. It uses its own package manager, Pacman, to install, update and manage packages. 

openSUSE Linux is created by the openSUSE Project Uses RPM package manager.  It offers an easy to use graphical installer/administration application (YaST) and a tiday base system, easy to tinker with.
